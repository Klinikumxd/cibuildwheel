Python wheels are great. Building them across **Mac, Linux, Windows**, on **multiple versions of Python**, is not.

`cibuildwheel` is here to help. `cibuildwheel` runs on your CI server - currently it supports Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, and CircleCI - and it builds and tests your wheels across all of your platforms.

**`cibuildwheel` is in beta**. It's brand new - I'd love for you to try it and help make it better!

What does it do?
----------------

|   | macOS 10.6+ | manylinux i686 | manylinux x86_64 |  Windows 32bit | Windows 64bit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Python 2.7 | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ  |
| Python 3.4 | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ* | ‚úÖ* |
| Python 3.5 | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ  |
| Python 3.6 | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ  |
| Python 3.7 | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ  |

> \* Not supported on Azure Pipelines

- Builds manylinux, macOS and Windows (32 and 64bit) wheels using Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, AppVeyor, and CircleCI
- Bundles shared library dependencies on Linux and macOS through [auditwheel](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel) and [delocate](https://github.com/matthew-brett/delocate)
- Runs the library test suite against the wheel-installed version of your library

Usage
-----

`cibuildwheel` currently works  **Travis CI** and **CircleCI** to build Linux and Mac wheels, and **AppVeyor** to build Windows wheels. **Azure Pipelines** supports all three.

|                 | Linux | macOS | Windows |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|
| Azure Pipelines | ‚úÖ    | ‚úÖ    | ‚úÖ      |
| Travis CI       | ‚úÖ    | ‚úÖ    |         |
| AppVeyor        |       |       | ‚úÖ      |
| CircleCI        | ‚úÖ    | ‚úÖ    |         |

`cibuildwheel` is not intended to run on your development machine. It will try to install packages globally; this is no good. Travis CI, CircleCI, and AppVeyor run their builds in isolated environments, so are ideal for this kind of script.


### Linux builds on Docker

Linux wheels are built in the [`manylinux1` docker images](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux) to provide binary compatible wheels on Linux, according to [PEP 513](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/). Because of this, when building with `cibuildwheel` on Linux, a few things should be taken into account:
- Programs and libraries cannot be installed on the Travis CI Ubuntu host with `apt-get`, but can be installed inside of the Docker image using `yum` or manually. The same goes for environment variables that are potentially needed to customize the wheel building. `cibuildwheel` supports this by providing the `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT` and `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD` options to setup the build environment inside the running Docker image. See [below](#options) for details on these options.
- The project directory is mounted in the running Docker instance as `/project`, the output directory for the wheels as `/output`. In general, this is handled transparently by `cibuildwheel`. For a more finegrained level of control however, the root of the host file system is mounted as `/host`, allowing for example to access shared files, caches, etc. on the host file system.  Note that this is not available on CircleCI due to their Docker policies.
- Alternative dockers images can be specified with the `CIBW_MANYLINUX1_X86_64_IMAGE` and `CIBW_MANYLINUX1_I686_IMAGE` options to allow for a custom, preconfigured build environment for the Linux builds. See [below](#options) for more details.


Options
-------

```
usage: cibuildwheel [-h] [--platform {auto,linux,macos,windows}]
                    [--output-dir OUTPUT_DIR] [--print-build-identifiers]
                    [project_dir]
    
Build wheels for all the platforms.

positional arguments:
  project_dir           Path to the project that you want wheels for.
                        Default: the current directory.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --platform {auto,linux,macos,windows}
                        Platform to build for. For "linux" you need docker
                        running, on Mac or Linux. For "macos", you need a Mac
                        machine, and note that this script is going to
                        automatically install MacPython on your system, so
                        don't run on your development machine. For "windows",
                        you need to run in Windows, and it will build and test
                        for all versions of Python at C:\PythonXX[-x64].
  --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        Destination folder for the wheels.
  --print-build-identifiers
                        Print the build identifiers matched by the current
                        invocation and exit.

```

### Example YML syntax

<table>
<tr><td><i>example .travis.yml environment variables</i><pre><code>env:
  global:
    - CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES=nose
    - CIBW_TEST_COMMAND="nosetests {project}/tests"
</code></pre></td>
<td><i>example appveyor.yml environment variables</i><pre><code>environment:
  global:
    CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES: nose
    CIBW_TEST_COMMAND: "nosetests {project}\\tests"
</code></pre></td>
</tr></table>

Delivering to PyPI
------------------

After you've built your wheels, you'll probably want to deliver them to PyPI.

### Manual method

On your development machine, do the following...

```bash
# Clear out your 'dist' folder. 
rm -rf dist
# Make a source distribution
python setup.py sdist

# üèÉüèª
# Go and download your wheel files from wherever you put them. Put 
# them all into the 'dist' folder.

# Upload using 'twine' (you may need to 'pip install twine')
twine upload dist/*
```

### Semi-automatic method using wheelhouse-uploader

Obviously, manual steps are for chumps, so we can automate this a little by using [wheelhouse-uploader](https://github.com/ogrisel/wheelhouse-uploader).

> Quick note from me - using S3 as a storage didn't work due to a [bug](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LIBCLOUD-792) in libcloud. Feel free to use my fork of that package that fixes the bug `pip install https://github.com/joerick/libcloud/archive/v1.5.0-s3fix.zip`

### Automatic method

If you don't need much control over the release of a package, you can set up cibuildwheel to deliver the wheels straight to PyPI. This doesn't require any cloud storage to work - you just need to bump the version and tag it.

Check out [this example repo](https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel-autopypi-example) for instructions on how to set this up.

It didn't work!
---------------

If your wheel didn't compile, check the list below for some debugging tips.

- A mistake in your config. To quickly test your config without doing a git push and waiting for your code to build on CI, you can run the Linux build in a Docker container. On Mac or Linux, with Docker running, try `cibuildwheel --platform linux`. You'll have to bring your config into the current environment first.
- Missing dependency. You might need to install something on the build machine. You can do this in `.travis.yml`, `appveyor.yml`, or `.circleci/config.yml`, with apt-get, brew or whatever Windows uses :P . Given how the Linux build works, we'll probably have to build something into `cibuildwheel`. Let's chat about that over in the issues!
- Windows: missing C feature. The Windows C compiler doesn't support C language features invented after 1990, so you'll have to backport your C code to C90. For me, this mostly involved putting my variable declarations at the top of the function like an animal.
- MacOS: calling cibuildwheel from a python3 script and getting a `ModuleNotFoundError`? Due to a [bug](https://bugs.python.org/issue22490) in CPython, you'll need to [unset the `__PYVENV_LAUNCHER__` variable](https://github.com/joerick/cibuildwheel/issues/133#issuecomment-478288597) before activating a venv.

Legal note
----------

Since `cibuildwheel` runs the wheel through delocate or auditwheel, it might automatically bundle dynamically linked libraries from the build machine. 

It helps ensure that the library can run without any dependencies outside of the pip toolchain.

This is similar to static linking, so it might have some licence implications. Check the license for any code you're pulling in to make sure that's allowed.

Contributing
============

Wheel-building is pretty complex. I expect users to find many edge-cases - please help the rest of the community out by documenting these, adding features to support them, and reporting bugs.

I plan to be pretty liberal in accepting pull requests, as long as they align with the design goals below.

`cibuildwheel` is indie open source. I'm not paid to work on this.

Design Goals
------------

- `cibuildwheel` should wrap the complexity of wheel building.
- The user interface to `cibuildwheel` is the build script (e.g. `.travis.yml`). Feature additions should not increase the complexity of this script.
- Options should be environment variables (these lend themselves better to YML config files). They should be prefixed with `CIBW_`.
- Options should be generalise to all platforms. If platform-specific options are required, they should be namespaced e.g. `CIBW_TEST_COMMAND_MACOS`

Other notes:

- The platforms are very similar, until they're not. I'd rather have straight-forward code than totally DRY code, so let's keep airy platfrom abstractions to a minimum.
- I might want to break the options into a shared config file one day, so that config is more easily shared. That has motivated some of the design decisions.

If you'd like to keep wheel building separate from the package itself, check out [astrofrog/autowheel](https://github.com/astrofrog/autowheel). It builds packages using cibuildwheel from source distributions on PyPI.

If `cibuildwheel` is too limited for your needs, consider [matthew-brett/multibuild](http://github.com/matthew-brett/multibuild). `multibuild` is a toolbox for building a wheel on various platforms. It can do a lot more than this project - it's used to build SciPy!
