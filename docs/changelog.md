=========

### 0.12.0

_29 September 2019_

- ✨ Add CIBW_TEST_EXTRAS option, to allow testing using extra_require

### 0.11.0

_26 May 2019_

- ✨ Add support for building on Azure pipelines! This lets you build all

- 🐛 Fixed a bug where cibuildwheel would download and build a package from PyPI(!) instead of building the package on the local machine. (#51)

### 0.6.0

_9 October 2017_

- ✨ On the Linux build, the host filesystem is now accessible via `/host` (#36)

### 0.4.1

_14 August 2017_

### 0.4.0

_23 July 2017_

- 🐛 Fixed a bug that was increasing the build time by building the wheel twice. This was a problem for large projects that have a long build time. If you're upgrading and you need the old behaviour, use `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD={pip} install .`, or install exactly the dependencies you need in `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD`. See #18.

- ⚠️ Removed Python 2.6 support on Linux (#12)
